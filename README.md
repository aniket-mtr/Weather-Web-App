# Weather for next seven days
A simple web app, in which we can select a specific city to get the weather data for that city for the upcoming seven days.
Includes details on minimum and maximum temperature and type of weather such as clear/cloudy/snow/rain/thunderstorm etc..
Data fetched using 7 timer api.

## Setup (very simple)
- Clone the repository
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/aniket-mtr/Weather-Web-App
- Open the directory in a code editor (VS code) and use the live server extension to start a live server
- Go to ```http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html```
